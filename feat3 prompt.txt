I'm working on my frontend options trading copilot app (React.js). The backend AI agent (Python with LangGraph) returns a LangGraph state object in its API response. **Crucially, this state object contains a list field named `dash_outputs`. Each item in this list is an object with the structured data result and an "intent" flag (or similar type indicator) that tells the UI what kind of data it is and how it might be displayed.**

My goal is to create a dashboard panel adjacent to the chat window. This dashboard should iterate through the `dash_outputs` list from the latest API response for the current chat thread and render each item appropriately based on its "intent". This will provide a "rolling feed" of visualization-ready data.

Please refer to the `feature_3_ui_display_langgraph_state.md` file in my workspace for detailed requirements and guidelines (I've updated it with this `dash_outputs` information).

I'd like to approach this iteratively. Please guide me **step-by-step** through the following, allowing me to review and test each part before moving to the next:

**Step 1: Locate and Understand `dash_outputs`**
*   First, help me identify where my frontend code receives the API response and how to access the `dash_outputs` list within the LangGraph state object.
*   Then, let's examine the typical structure of items within `dash_outputs` from my codebase, focusing on how the "intent" and "structured data result" are represented for 1-2 example items.
    *   _Output for this step:_ Confirmation of how to access `dash_outputs` and an understanding of its item structure.

**Step 2: Basic Dashboard Component Setup**
*   Next, guide me in creating the basic structure for a new React component (e.g., `ChatDashboard.js`) that will display these `dash_outputs`. For now, it can be a simple placeholder.
*   Help me integrate this placeholder component into my existing UI layout, likely adjacent to the chat window and associated with the current chat session.
    *   _Output for this step:_ Code for the basic `ChatDashboard.js` component and guidance on its placement.

**Step 3: Processing and Displaying Initial `dash_outputs` Items**
*   Once the component is in place, show me how to pass the `dash_outputs` list to this `ChatDashboard` component.
*   Guide me in iterating through the `dash_outputs` list. For 1-2 example "intents" we identified in Step 1, show me how to:
    *   Implement simple conditional logic (e.g., a switch statement or if/else) based on the "intent".
    *   Render a very basic placeholder display (e.g., just text showing the intent and a snippet of the data) for these initial intents.
    *   Pass the "structured data result" to these placeholder displays.
    *   _Output for this step:_ Code modifications to pass the `dash_outputs` list, iterate it, and conditionally render simple placeholders for a couple of intents.

**Step 4: Dynamic Updates & Further Refinement (Iterative)**
*   After we confirm the basic display is working and updating with new API responses, we can then iterate on:
    *   Creating more specific React sub-components for different "intents".
    *   Implementing actual data visualizations for certain intents (e.g., simple tables or data lists, placeholders for future charts).
    *   Refining state management for the `dash_outputs` list.
    *   Improving styling.

Please focus on integrating this into my existing React codebase. Let's start with **Step 1**. I'll let you know when I'm ready to proceed to subsequent steps.
